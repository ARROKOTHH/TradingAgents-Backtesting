# 5.1 The Multi-Agent System

The core of this project's analytical power comes from its multi-agent system. Instead of relying on a single monolithic AI, the system delegates tasks to a team of specialized agents who collaborate, debate, and build upon each other's work. This approach is orchestrated using the **LangGraph** framework.

## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a library that allows for the creation of stateful, multi-actor applications (like our agent system). It extends the popular LangChain library. In our project, we use it to define the workflow of our agents as a "graph." Each "node" in the graph is an agent (or a tool), and the "edges" determine the flow of information from one agent to the next.

The main graph is defined in `tradingagents/graph/trading_graph.py`.

## The Agent Team

Our simulated investment research team consists of the following key agents:

#### 1. Analysts & Researchers
These agents are responsible for gathering and interpreting raw data.
-   **Market Analyst**: Focuses on broad market trends, sentiment, and news. Gathers data from sources like Google News.
-   **Fundamentals Analyst**: Dives deep into the company's financial health, analyzing balance sheets, income statements, and key financial ratios.
-   **News Analyst**: Specializes in processing and summarizing the latest news articles related to the stock.
-   **Bull Researcher / Bear Researcher**: These two agents form the core of the research process. They are tasked with building the strongest possible arguments *for* (Bull) and *against* (Bear) investing in the stock, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive analysis.

#### 2. Debators
These agents challenge the findings of the researchers to refine the analysis.
-   **Aggressive Debator**: Takes a more aggressive, risk-tolerant stance to challenge the "Bear" case.
-   **Conservative Debator**: Takes a more cautious, risk-averse stance to challenge the "Bull" case.
-   **Neutral Debator**: Acts as a moderator to ensure the debate remains productive.

#### 3. Managers
These agents provide oversight and make final decisions.
-   **Research Manager**: Oversees the entire research and debate process, ensuring all necessary steps are completed.
-   **Risk Manager**: Evaluates the final investment thesis from a risk perspective, identifying potential pitfalls and suggesting mitigation strategies.
-   **Trader**: The final decision-maker. This agent synthesizes all the information from the previous steps to produce the final, actionable investment report.
