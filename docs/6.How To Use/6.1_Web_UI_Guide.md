# 6.1 Web UI Guide

The Web UI, built with Streamlit, provides a user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with all the features of the TradingAgents-Backtesting platform.

## Launching the Web UI

To start the web server, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
# On Windows
start_web.bat

# On macOS/Linux
bash start_web.sh
```

Then, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Navigating the Interface

The interface is divided into a main content area and a sidebar on the left.

### The Sidebar

The sidebar is always visible and contains the primary navigation and configuration options.

1.  **Navigation**: Use the dropdown menu at the top of the sidebar to switch between the two main pages:
    *   **Stock Analysis**: For generating investment reports.
    *   **Strategy Generation & Backtesting**: For creating and testing strategies from reports.

2.  **LLM Configuration**: This is a crucial section where you select the LLM provider and models for the AI agents.
    *   **LLM Provider**: Choose from the list of supported providers (e.g., Google, OpenAI).
    *   **Deep Think Model**: Select the model to be used for complex, in-depth analysis tasks.
    *   **Fast Think Model**: Select the model for simpler, faster tasks like summarization.

### Page 1: Stock Analysis

This is the default page. Here, you can generate a comprehensive investment report.

1.  **Enter Stock Symbol**: In the main input box, type the stock ticker you want to analyze (e.g., `NVDA`, `AMD`).
2.  **Define Research Question**: You can leave the default question or provide a more specific one to guide the agents' research.
3.  **Run Analysis**: Click the "Run Analysis" button. The process will start, and you will see a progress bar and logs as the agents complete their tasks. This may take several minutes.
4.  **View and Save Report**: Once complete, the full analysis report will be displayed on the page. It is also automatically saved to the `analysis reports/` directory. You can choose between a "Full Report" and a "Strategy-Guided Report" (which is more focused for the backtesting phase).

### Page 2: Strategy Generation & Backtesting

On this page, you can turn a saved report into a backtestable trading strategy.

1.  **Select Analysis Report**: Choose one of the previously generated reports from the dropdown list.
2.  **Generate Strategy**: Click the "Generate Strategy" button. The system will use the selected LLM to generate the Python code for a `backtrader` strategy based on the report. The generated code will be displayed in a code block.
3.  **Set Backtesting Parameters**:
    *   **Start Date & End Date**: Define the historical period for the backtest.
    *   **Initial Capital**: Set the starting cash for the simulation.
4.  **Run Backtest**: Click the "Run Backtest" button. The engine will execute the strategy against the historical data.
5.  **Review Results**: The results will be displayed below, including:
    *   A plot showing the stock price, indicators, and buy/sell signals.
    *   Key performance metrics, such as the final portfolio value and net profit/loss.
