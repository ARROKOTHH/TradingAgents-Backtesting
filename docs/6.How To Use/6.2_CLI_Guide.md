# 6.2 CLI Guide

The Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides a powerful way to interact with the TradingAgents-Backtesting platform, ideal for automation, scripting, and users who prefer a terminal-based workflow.

## Launching the CLI

To start the CLI, run `main.py` from the `cli/` directory:

```bash
python cli/main.py
```

## Getting Help

The CLI is built with `Typer`, which provides automatic help documentation. To see a full list of available commands and their options, use the `--help` flag:

```bash
python cli/main.py --help
```

You can also get help for a specific command:
```bash
python cli/main.py analyze --help
```

## Common Commands

While the exact commands can be found via the `--help` option, here are some examples of how you might use the CLI.

### Running a Stock Analysis

The most common use case is to run a full stock analysis.

**Example:**
```bash
python cli/main.py analyze --stock-symbol "NVDA" --question "What is the long-term investment potential for NVIDIA?"
```

**Explanation:**
-   `analyze`: This is the main command to trigger the multi-agent analysis workflow.
-   `--stock-symbol "NVDA"`: Specifies the stock ticker to be analyzed.
-   `--question "..."`: (Optional) Provides a specific research question to guide the agents.

The CLI will print progress updates as the agents work and will save the final report to the `analysis reports/` directory, printing the file path to the console upon completion.

### Configuring LLMs for the CLI

The CLI, by default, will use the models specified in the `config/models.json` file. You can edit this file to change the default models used for CLI operations.

*Note: Unlike the Web UI, the CLI does not currently support on-the-fly model selection via command-line arguments. Configuration is handled through the JSON files.*

### Other Potential Commands

The CLI can be extended with more commands. Based on the project's functionality, future commands might include:

-   A command to run backtesting directly from the terminal.
-   A command to manage configurations or view usage statistics.

Always refer to the output of `python cli/main.py --help` for the most up-to-date list of available commands and features.
